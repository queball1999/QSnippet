message: |
  This update focuses on reliability and performance, with a handful of fixes that make creating and expanding snippets more predictable.

  **Features**
    - Verified compatibility with Python 3.14 through testing (not yet used during runtime).
    - Improved reliability of snippet expansion, especially with embedded or nested snippets.

  **Fixes**
    - The snippet service now pauses automatically while editing to prevent accidental triggers.
    - Fixed issues that required restarting the app after creating or importing snippets.
    - Resolved crashes caused by embedding snippets inside other snippets.
    - Removed Shiboken console spam ( `Cannot copy-convert NoneType to C++` ) triggered by clearing selections in the snippet table.

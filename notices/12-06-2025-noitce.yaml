message: |
  A new round of reliability and performance improvements has landed in QSnippet, including a major upgrade to Python 3.14 and several fixes that make snippet creation and expansion smoother than ever.

  **Features**
    - Updated the application runtime to Python 3.14 for better performance and long-term stability.
    - Improved reliability of snippet expansion, especially when using embedded or nested snippets.

  **Fixes**
    - Snippet service is now automatically paused while editing to prevent accidental triggers.
    - Resolved issues that required restarting the application after creating or importing snippets.
    - Fixed crashes related to embedding snippets inside one another.
    - Eliminated the Shiboken console spam (`Cannot copy-convert NoneType to C++`) caused by selection clearing in the snippet table.
